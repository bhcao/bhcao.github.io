### What are the inspirations of physics researches for computer vision researches?

As is well known, the diffusion model was inspired by the Langevin dynamics. In soft matter, the process of simulating physical systems is often the process of finding the optimal solution to the physical system. These optimization ideas can be well applied to the training of neural networks.
